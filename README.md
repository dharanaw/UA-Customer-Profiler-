# ocr
Sinhala OCR with character translations 



dict.py is the fist approach. Created a custom str type that fully inherits from str but adds phonetics and transliteration properties. 

character_map.py is the second approach for translation purpose. character mapping is implemented here. but it results the same output as approach 1



ui.py is the last version, a simple streamlit ui that works with Driving licence and new NIC. Sinhala transliteration and Sinhala handwriting detection has not implemented.
